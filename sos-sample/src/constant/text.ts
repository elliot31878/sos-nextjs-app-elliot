export const TextSample = `As a big advocate of Test-Driven Development (TDD), I have spent a good amount of time wondering why 95% of my conversations about TDD with other engineers go something like this:

“Yes, TDD is clearly the right way to build software. But I don’t actually do it.”

At this point, the usual reasons and explanations are laid out:

“It’s hard to know what tests to write until I have written the code.”

“How can I know how the tests should work if I don’t know how the code works?”

It is true that if you are testing something that uses completely unfamiliar technology, you probably don’t know yet how to go about testing it. Most of the time, though, the technology is perfectly familiar. It’s not the tools that are unfamiliar and scary - it’s the product that you are trying to build.`;
